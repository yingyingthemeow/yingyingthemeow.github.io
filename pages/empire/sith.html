                    <br>
                    <p>The feared enforcer of the Galactic Empire, Darth Vader is a towering figure clad in black armor and wielding immense power in the Dark Side of the Force. In The Empire Strikes Back, he is more ruthless than ever, relentlessly hunting down the Rebel Alliance and setting a trap for Luke on Cloud City. Vader demonstrates his mastery of the Force by choking subordinates from a distance, overpowering Luke in combat, and ultimately revealing his true identity as Luke’s father, Anakin Skywalker. His offer for Luke to join him and overthrow the Emperor adds complexity to his character, hinting at the internal conflict that still lingers within him.</p>

                    <h4>ABOUT</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>The shadowy ruler of the Galactic Empire, Palpatine (also known as Darth Sidious) appears only briefly in The Empire Strikes Back, but his influence looms large. Communicating with Vader via hologram, he expresses concern about Luke Skywalker’s growing power and suggests that he must either be turned to the Dark Side or eliminated. Palpatine’s manipulation is subtle yet ominous, as he continues to orchestrate events behind the scenes, ensuring that his iron grip on the galaxy remains unchallenged. His control over Vader is evident, reinforcing his status as the true mastermind of the Sith.</p>
