                    <br>
                    <p>A desolate, icy planet in the Outer Rim, Hoth serves as the secret base of the Rebel Alliance at the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back. The Rebels establish Echo Base within its frozen caverns, but their presence is discovered by an Imperial probe droid. This leads to a massive battle between the Empire and the Rebels, where AT-AT walkers assault the base, forcing the Rebels to evacuate in a desperate retreat. The planet’s harsh blizzards and freezing temperatures make survival difficult, as seen when Luke Skywalker is nearly lost in the snow after being attacked by a wampa.</p>

                    <p>A remote, swamp-covered planet teeming with strange creatures and shrouded in mist, Dagobah is where Luke Skywalker seeks out Jedi Master Yoda to continue his training in the ways of the Force. Isolated from civilization, the planet provides an ideal hiding place for Yoda after the fall of the Jedi Order. In the film, Luke undergoes rigorous training, learning about the Force and facing a vision of Darth Vader in a mysterious cave, which foreshadows his true lineage.</p>

                    <p>A gas giant with floating city platforms, including the famous Cloud City, ruled by Lando Calrissian. This luxurious yet dangerous city, suspended above the planet’s gaseous depths, becomes a pivotal location in The Empire Strikes Back. Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO seek refuge there, only to be betrayed by Lando, who is forced to turn them over to Darth Vader. The city is the setting for the dramatic duel between Luke Skywalker and Vader, where Luke learns the shocking truth about his father. Han Solo is also frozen in carbonite here and handed over to the bounty hunter Boba Fett.</p>

                    <p>Though not featured prominently in The Empire Strikes Back, Tatooine is briefly mentioned. It remains significant as Luke Skywalker's home planet, a desert world where he was raised by his aunt and uncle. At the end of the film, Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca prepare to travel to Tatooine in an effort to rescue Han Solo, who has been taken by Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. This sets up the events of Return of the Jedi, where the rescue mission unfolds.</p>
