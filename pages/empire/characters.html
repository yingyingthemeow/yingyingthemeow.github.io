                    <p>A skilled smuggler and reluctant hero, Han Solo is initially in it for the money, but over the course of The Empire Strikes Back, his loyalty to his friends and the Rebel Alliance grows. Han's sharp wit and self-assured demeanor make him a fan favorite, and his romance with Leia deepens, though it's complicated by the pressures of war. His daring escape from the Empire’s clutches in the Millennium Falcon, alongside his loyal Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca, showcases his bravery and quick thinking. Han's conflict with Vader culminates in his betrayal by Lando Calrissian, leading to his capture and eventual freezing in carbonite.</p>
