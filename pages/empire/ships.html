                    <p>The Millennium Falcon is a heavily modified YT-1300 Corellian freighter. Piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, 
                        the ship plays a central role in The Empire Strikes Back, narrowly escaping the Empire on Hoth before
                         being relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader’s fleet. Despite its hyperdrive malfunctioning repeatedly,
                          Han expertly navigates the Falcon through an asteroid field and even hides it on the back of a Star
                           Destroyer to evade capture. However, the ship is ultimately betrayed by Lando Calrissian in Cloud City,
                            leading to Han's capture. Leia, Chewie, and Lando later use the Falcon to escape Bespin and rescue Luke.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The Empire’s TIE Fighters are fast, agile, and deadly in numbers, though they lack shields, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. In The Empire Strikes Back, TIE Fighters are deployed to chase the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, where many are destroyed due to their inability to handle such hazardous terrain. They also escort the Imperial fleet in pursuit of the Rebel forces. The distinct scream of their engines, a signature sound of the Empire’s military presence, is heard frequently in the film.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The X-Wing is the main starfighter of the Rebel Alliance, balancing speed, firepower, and durability. In The Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker flies his X-Wing to the swampy planet of Dagobah in search of Jedi Master Yoda. The ship sinks into the bog, and Luke initially doubts his ability to lift it using the Force. Yoda later demonstrates his mastery by effortlessly raising the X-Wing from the swamp, proving that size is irrelevant when using the Force. The X-Wing later plays a crucial role in Luke’s escape from Cloud City after his duel with Darth Vader.

                    <br>
                    <p>These massive four-legged Imperial walkers play a key role in the Battle of Hoth, attacking the Rebel base with heavy laser cannons and thick armor. The Rebels struggle to stop them with conventional blaster fire, leading to their use of harpoons and tow cables to trip the walkers—a strategy that proves effective. AT-ATs are imposing war machines that symbolize the overwhelming force of the Empire, crushing everything in their path as they advance on Echo Base. One particularly famous walker, piloted by General Veers, successfully destroys the Rebel shield generator, forcing a full-scale retreat.</p>

                    <P>Boba Fett's personal starship, Slave I, is a heavily modified Firespray-31-class patrol craft equipped with advanced weapons and tracking systems. In The Empire Strikes Back, Fett uses the ship to track Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City after correctly predicting Han’s strategy of floating away with the Star Destroyer’s garbage. Once Han is frozen in carbonite, Slave I is used to transport him to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. The ship’s unique vertical design and powerful arsenal make it one of the most recognizable and feared vessels in the Star Wars universe.</P>
