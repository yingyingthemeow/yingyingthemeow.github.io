                    <br>
                    <p>Still a young and inexperienced Jedi-in-training, Luke spends much of The Empire Strikes Back struggling to understand the Force. His journey leads him to the swampy world of Dagobah, where he begins rigorous training under Yoda. Throughout the film, Luke grapples with self-doubt, impatience, and the fear of failure, which are tested when he has a vision of his friends in danger. Against Yoda’s advice, he leaves his training early to confront Darth Vader, only to suffer a devastating defeat—both physically and emotionally—when he learns the shocking truth about his lineage.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A wise and enigmatic Jedi Master, Yoda lives in exile on Dagobah, having survived the Jedi Purge. Though small in stature, his wisdom and power in the Force are immense. Initially skeptical of Luke’s readiness, he reluctantly agrees to train him but constantly warns the young Jedi about the dangers of fear, anger, and recklessness. Yoda emphasizes patience, discipline, and the importance of truly understanding the Force. However, Luke’s impulsive nature worries him, as he fears the young Skywalker may follow in the tragic footsteps of his father.</p>
