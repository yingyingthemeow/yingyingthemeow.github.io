                    <p>Chewbacca – A towering, furry warrior from the planet Kashyyyk, Chewbacca is Han Solo’s loyal co-pilot aboard the Millennium Falcon. In The Empire Strikes Back, Chewie plays a crucial role in helping his friends escape from the Empire. His technical skills are on display as he attempts to repair the Falcon’s malfunctioning hyperdrive, all while evading Imperial forces. He also shows deep emotional bonds with Han, visibly distressed when Solo is frozen in carbonite. Though he primarily communicates through growls and roars, his fierce loyalty and strength make him a vital ally in the fight against the Empire.</p>

                    <p>Tauntauns - These reptilian, snow-adapted creatures serve as the primary mode of transportation for the Rebel forces on Hoth. They have thick fur and strong legs, allowing them to navigate the harsh terrain. Luke Skywalker and Han Solo ride them while patrolling the icy wastelands.
                        <br>
                        Wampas - Massive, white-furred predators native to Hoth, wampas are highly dangerous creatures that blend into the snowy environment. One attacks Luke at the start of the film, knocking him unconscious and dragging him to its cave.

                    <br>
                    <p>Though they do not play a significant role in The Empire Strikes Back, Twi’leks are a well-known species in the Star Wars universe. Recognizable by their colorful skin and head-tails (lekku), they are often seen in various social and political roles, from dancers and merchants to military leaders. While none appear prominently in this film, they are a staple of the galaxy’s diverse species.</p>

                    <h4>ABOUT</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Best known for Greedo from A New Hope, Rodians are green-skinned, bug-eyed humanoids frequently depicted as bounty hunters, mercenaries, or criminals. Though no major Rodian characters are featured in The Empire Strikes Back, the film continues the Star Wars underworld theme by introducing a variety of bounty hunters, including Bossk, IG-88, and Boba Fett, who all work under Darth Vader to capture Han Solo. This reinforces the idea that Rodians, like many alien species, are part of the galaxy’s vast network of smugglers and hired guns.</p>
