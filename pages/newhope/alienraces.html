                        <p>Wookiees are large, intelligent, and incredibly strong humanoid creatures covered in thick fur. Native to the forested planet of Kashyyyk, they are known for their deep sense of honor and loyalty. Despite their inability to speak Galactic Basic, Wookiees communicate through growls and roars. The most famous Wookiee is Chewbacca, Han Solo’s co-pilot aboard the Millennium Falcon. Chewbacca fights alongside the Rebel Alliance and proves his courage during their mission to destroy the Death Star.</p>

                        <p>Twi’leks are a striking humanoid species characterized by their long, fleshy head-tails known as "lekku." These appendages aid in communication and are highly sensitive. While they became more prominent in Return of the Jedi with Jabba the Hutt’s entourage, a Twi’lek can be briefly spotted in A New Hope within the seedy depths of Mos Eisley’s Cantina. Their homeworld, Ryloth, is a harsh desert planet, leading many Twi’leks to seek opportunities as traders, entertainers, or criminals.</p>

They hail from the crime-ridden planet of Rodia, where bounty hunting is a respected profession. In A New Hope, the most famous Rodian is Greedo, a bounty hunter working for Jabba the Hutt. He tracks Han Solo to the Mos Eisley Cantina, but their confrontation ends abruptly when Han shoots him first—solidifying one of the most iconic moments in Star Wars history.</p>

                        <p>Jawas are a mysterious, diminutive species native to the desert planet Tatooine. Recognizable by their glowing yellow eyes and hooded brown robes, Jawas are skilled scavengers and traders, often salvaging droids and machinery from crashed starships or abandoned settlements. In A New Hope, they capture R2-D2 and C-3PO and later sell them to Luke Skywalker’s uncle, Owen Lars. Their sandcrawler vehicles are massive mobile fortresses, filled with an assortment of junk and droid parts.</p>

They wear heavy robes and masks to protect themselves from the harsh desert sun. Tuskens are known for their aggressive nature and ambush tactics, wielding deadly gaffi sticks. In A New Hope, they attack Luke Skywalker while he searches for R2-D2, only to be scared away by Obi-Wan Kenobi using a mimicry of a Krayt dragon’s call.</p>

While they do not appear in A New Hope, they become crucial to the Rebel Alliance later in the original trilogy. Admiral Ackbar, one of their most notable leaders, helps command the fleet during the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi. Their advanced shipbuilding skills make them invaluable to the Rebellion.</p>

In A New Hope, a Duros can be seen sitting in the Mos Eisley Cantina, highlighting the diverse crowd that frequents the establishment. Their homeworld, Duro, is a major hub for space travel and commerce, making them frequent travelers across the galaxy.</p>

While they do not appear in A New Hope, they are later introduced in Return of the Jedi as Jabba the Hutt’s palace guards. Despite their intimidating appearance, Gamorreans are often easily tricked or overpowered by more cunning individuals.</p>
