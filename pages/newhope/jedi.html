                        <p>At the start of the film, Luke is a farm boy on Tatooine with no knowledge of his Jedi heritage. After meeting Obi-Wan, he begins to learn about the Force and his father’s past as a Jedi Knight. He receives his first training aboard the Millennium Falcon, where he practices using the Force with a lightsaber and a training remote. By the film's end, he demonstrates his growing connection to the Force by successfully destroying the Death Star without relying on his targeting computer, following Obi-Wan's guidance.</p>
